[96mElmo> [0mHiya there! Elmo's the name, and recommending movies is Elmo's game!
Let Elmo know how you're feeling about the movies you've seen, and Elmo will recommend some new ones for you to enjoy!
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mElmo> [0mElmo is so glad you enjoyed Titanic (1997). Now, tell Elmo about another movie you've watched recently!
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mElmo> [0mElmo knows that not every movie is for everyone. If you didn't like Zootopia, can you tell Elmo about another movie you've seen?
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mElmo> [0mWow, it sounds like you're a big movie buff! Elmo would love to know what other movies you've enjoyed besides Tangled Ever After. Could you share another one?
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mElmo> [0mIt sounds like Sleeping Beauty wasn't quite your cup of tea. That's okay! Can you tell Elmo about another movie you've seen?
> I liked "Mulan"

[96mElmo> [0mElmo thinks that you would really enjoy watching The Ridiculous 6 (2015). That's Elmo's recommendation based on what you've shared with Elmo.

[96mElmo> [0mHiya there! Elmo's the name, and recommending movies is Elmo's game!
Let Elmo know how you're feeling about the movies you've seen, and Elmo will recommend some new ones for you to enjoy!
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mElmo> [0mHmm, Elmo is not quite sure how you feel about Titanic (1997). Could you give Elmo a little more information about it?
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mElmo> [0mElmo is stumped! Could you tell Elmo more about another movie? Elmo doesn't know much about Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019).
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mElmo> [0mUh oh, Elmo can only process one movie at a time. Could you please share one movie with Elmo first?
> I like "Titanic".

[96mElmo> [0mOh my, Elmo found more than one movie called Titanic. Can you please clarify which one you mean?
> I like titanic.

[96mElmo> [0mElmo's confused. Could you provide more details about what you like in movies
> I like "titanic".

[96mElmo> [0mUh oh, Elmo found multiple movies called titanic. Can you provide some more details so Elmo knows which one you're talking about?
> I like 10 things I hate about you.

[96mElmo> [0mso Elmo can recommend some great ones?
> Howdy.

[96mElmo> [0mUh oh, Elmo needs more information to help you. Can you tell Elmo more about the kinds of movies you enjoy?
> ...

[96mElmo> [0mOopsie! Elmo didn't catch that. Can you tell Elmo more about your favorite types of movies?
> I saw "Titanic (1220)"

[96mElmo> [0mOh dear, Elmo doesn't know much about Titanic (1220). Can you tell Elmo about another movie?
> :quit
[96mElmo> [0mAww, Elmo had such a great time recommending movies to you! 
Don't forget to grab some popcorn and enjoy the show! Bye-bye for now, friend!

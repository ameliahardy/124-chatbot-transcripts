Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mSpongebob> [0mHi, how are ya? I'm Spongebob, glad to meet ya! 
Mr Krabs gave me some time off from the Krusty Krab today. 
I'm a bit bummed but now I can recommend you some movies. 
I'm reaaaaaaaaaaaaaady!! Give me some movies! 
To help me out, put the movie name and date in quotes, e.g. "Titanic (1997)".
Let's go!
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mSpongebob> [0mI'm sorry friend. I'm not sure whether you liked Titanic (1997). Can you tell me more about the movie(s)? Gimme some good words, you love it.
What about another movie? Tell me more! This is great!
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mSpongebob> [0mHmmmm Sorry. I've never heard of Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019). Can you tell me more about a different movie you liked or disliked that I would know?
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mSpongebob> [0mOh, I get it now. I see that you like Titanic (1997)! I thought that one was kind of mid personally.
Oh, I get it now. I see that you like Scream (1996)! I thought that one was kind of mid personally.
Oh, I get it now. I see that you like 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)! I thought that one was kind of mid personally.
What about another movie? Tell me more! This is great!
> I like "Titanic".

[96mSpongebob> [0mAgh! Shrimp paste, there's too many possible movies. Could you narrow it down a bit more for me here?
> I like titanic.

[96mSpongebob> [0mI see that you didn't like 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)! Yeah, that one is about as good as Squiddy's clarinet solo.
I see that you didn't like 10 (1979)! Yeah, that one is about as good as Squiddy's clarinet solo.

> Howdy.

Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mSpongebob> [0mHi, how are ya? I'm Spongebob, glad to meet ya! 
Mr Krabs gave me some time off from the Krusty Krab today. 
I'm a bit bummed but now I can recommend you some movies. 
I'm reaaaaaaaaaaaaaady!! Give me some movies! 
To help me out, put the movie name and date in quotes, e.g. "Titanic (1997)".
Let's go!
> Hello!

[96mSpongebob> [0mAhoy there matey! I'm ready!
> I am feeling sad.

[96mSpongebob> [0mBarnacles. Sorry about making you sad. Shrimp paste.
> I am feeling angry.

[96mSpongebob> [0mBarnacles. Sorry about making you angry. Shrimp paste.
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mSpongebob> [0mWhaddya mean by that one? Is it still movie time? Baaahahahahaha
> I'm so glad that I finished my exams.

[96mSpongebob> [0mAgh! Shrimp paste, there's too many possible movies. Could you narrow it down a bit more for me here?
> I am very angry.

[96mSpongebob> [0mBarnacles. Sorry about making you angry. Shrimp paste.

[96mSpongebob> [0mAgh! Shrimp paste, there's too many possible movies. Could you narrow it down a bit more for me here?

[96mSpongebob> [0mWhaddya mean by that one? Is it still movie time? Baaahahahahaha
> "Titanic (1997)" makes me afraid of ice.

[96mSpongebob> [0mI see that you didn't like Titanic (1997)! Yeah, that one is about as good as Squiddy's clarinet solo.
What about another movie? Tell me more! This is great!

Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mSpongebob> [0mHi, how are ya? I'm Spongebob, glad to meet ya! 
Mr Krabs gave me some time off from the Krusty Krab today. 
I'm a bit bummed but now I can recommend you some movies. 
I'm reaaaaaaaaaaaaaady!! Give me some movies! 
To help me out, put the movie name and date in quotes, e.g. "Titanic (1997)".
Let's go!
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mSpongebob> [0mI see that you didn't like Titanic (1997)! Yeah, that one is about as good as Squiddy's clarinet solo.
I see that you didn't like Ex Machina (2015)! Yeah, that one is about as good as Squiddy's clarinet solo.
What about another movie? Tell me more! This is great!
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mSpongebob> [0mAgh! Shrimp paste, there's too many possible movies. Could you narrow it down a bit more for me here?
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mSpongebob> [0mI see that you hate Zootopia (2016)! Everyone in Bikini Bottom does too!
I see that you hate Eat Pray Love (2010)! Everyone in Bikini Bottom does too!
What about another movie? Tell me more! This is great!
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"

[96mSpongebob> [0mOh, I get it now. I see that you like Zootopia (2016)! I thought that one was kind of mid personally.
Oh, I get it now. I see that you like Blade Runner (1982)! I thought that one was kind of mid personally.
Oh, I get it now. I see that you like Notebook, The (2004)! I thought that one was kind of mid personally.
That's enough movies for me. Would you like a movie recommendation now? We can go see it now!
If so, please type 'yes' or 'y'. If you're done, type 'no' or 'n'.

[96mSpongebob> [0mAh, barnacles, we're done? Well, no problemo. See you next time!

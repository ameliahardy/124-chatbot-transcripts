Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!

I'm a bit bummed but now I can recommend you some movies. 
I'm reaaaaaaaaaaaaaady!! Give me some movies! 
To help me out, put the movie name and date in quotes, e.g. "Titanic (1997)".
Let's go!

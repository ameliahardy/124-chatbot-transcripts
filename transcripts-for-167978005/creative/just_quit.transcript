Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            "Yahooo! It's-a me, Mario, and I'm in creative mode, woo hoo! 
            I'm your movie recommending chat bot, and I'm ready to help you 
            find some-a great movies! Just give me your opinion, no matter how-a strong,
            on 5 movies, and I'll-a find you one that I think you'll love! And don't-a 
            worry, you can keep adding your preferences, more than one at a time too,
            and I'll keep making recommendations based on previous entries! Movie titles
            can be with or without-a quotation marks, and you don't-a need to worry about
            your poor spelling abilities, hahaha! 
            Let's-a gooooo!"

[96mmoviebot> [0mHi! I'm MovieBot! I'm going to recommend a movie to you. First I will ask you about your taste in movies. Tell me about a movie that you have seen.

Got it, you liked 'Blade Runner'
[96mmoviebot> [0mWhat's another movie you liked/disliked?

[96mmoviebot> [0mLet's talk about something else for now.

[96mmoviebot> [0mI found more than one movie called 'Scream'. Which one did you mean? ['Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991)', 'Scream 3 (2000)', 'Scream 2 (1997)', 'Scream (1996)']

> I didn't like that movie.

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm still not sure which movie you're talking about. Try being more specific!

> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

Got it, you didn't like 'Zootopia'
[96mmoviebot> [0mWhat's another movie you liked/disliked?

That's all the info I needed! Let me think about what kind of movies you'd like...
[96mmoviebot> [0mI recommend you watch Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Would you like more movie recommendations?

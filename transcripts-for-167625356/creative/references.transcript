Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        I can recommend movies to you if you tell me your feelings about
        a few of them. You can hit enter once you're done typing so I can 
        respond. Make sure to enclose the movie names in double quotes 
        if you're running in basic mode. 
        
[96mApril> [0mUm hi I'm April Ludgate, I'm only here because I get college credit for this. Tell me about your movie taste, or don't. I don't really care.
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mApril> [0mYou thought "Blade Runner" was pretty good? I didn't. How do you feel about another movie? I feel like going home.
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mApril> [0mYou thought "Terminator Salvation" could've been better? I think you could've been better. Burned. How do you feel about another movie? I feel like going home.
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mApril> [0mI don't know what you're talking about, check your format.
> I liked it.

[96mApril> [0mThere are multiple movies with the name "it", can you please just be more specific. Ugh.
> I watched "Scream".

[96mApril> [0mI've never heard of "I watched "Scream".". I bet it's weird. I like weird. Um ok, tell me about another movie.
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mApril> [0mI don't know what you're talking about, check your format.
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mApril> [0mNot that I care, but tell me more about "Zootopia".
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mApril> [0mJeez, just tell me if you like "Ex Machina" or not.
> :quit
[96mApril> [0mBye I guess.

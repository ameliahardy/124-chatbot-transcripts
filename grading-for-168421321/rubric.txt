Chetan: Collaborated with Mena in developing the following features:
1. extract_sentiment
2. recommend
3. similarity
4. binarize
5. process - dialogue for spellchecking and disambiguation, communicating multiple sentiments,
    responding to emotions, responding to arbitrary input
6. fine-grain-sentiment
7. extracting sentiment with multiple movie input
8. disambiguation part 2

Mothana: 
1. find movies- coded an implementation that got most but not all test cases
2. find movies closest title/spell check- implemented this and the edit distance helper to get every test case/sanity check working
3. extract titles- did an implementation for the starter tests and also for creative mode, but creative mode didn’t work for cases with missing quotations,
4. disambiguate 2- attempted the creative part and got 1/2 test cases
Collaborated with Ifdita on developing the above features.

Ifdita: 
I worked on the functions 
1. Extract Titles 
2. Find movies by title 
3. finding movies closest to a title 
I wrote the Ethics write-up
Collaborated with Mothana on developing the above features.

We all worked together to come up with the persona and modify the responses to be 
consistent with the persona we decided. We all also had multiple rounds of code 
review and debugging where we would get together to review each other's code 
and help debug any issues that we came across with the test cases and scripts.

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

When we anthropomorphize chatbot systems and give them human attributes, humans engaging with these chatbots for 
example, during therapy sessions are more likely to develop unrealistic expectations  and strong emotional connection 
with the chatbots. However, if the chatbot fails to understand or respond appropriately, it can cause negative feelings 
in the person. There will be instances when the users will realize that the chatbot they are talking to is not human, 
causing detrimental effects on their mental health. Users who have less knowledge of the technical aspects of chatbots may assume 
that they are accurate sources of advice and blindly follow their suggestions even when the suggestions are not beneficial. 
Furthermore, a chatbot with malicious feature can lead to the disclosure of sensitive user information, breaching their privacy. 

Ways to distinguish chatbot responses from those of a human:
Engineers can put a visible disclaimer like ”I AM A ROBOT” on the interface, so that users know that they are talking to a robot through out the conversation. 
Chatbots can also be designed to give a straight forward introduction, claiming that it is a robot. 
Incorporate different wording/ tone into the chatbot that would distinguish the chatbot from a human.

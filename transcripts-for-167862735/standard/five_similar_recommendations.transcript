[96mRoger> [0mI'm a fan of "Titanic (1997)" too! Any other films you feel strongly about one way or the other?

[96mRoger> [0mI'm glad to hear that you're a fan of "Tangled Ever After" as well! What other movies do you have reviews or ratings for?

[96mRoger> [0mIt's interesting to hear you didn't like "Sleeping Beauty" â€” it's a classic in the chabot community. What's another move you have strong feelings about?

Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Below is an experimental Dr. Seuss chatbot. It understands movie titles in quotes, but you'll probably have to work a bit to understand its responses. That's the joy of Dr. Seuss!
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh me, oh my! What wonderful day! I'm a Dr. Seuss chatbot and I would like to say: do you have a dearest flick, a cinematic pic?
> Hello!

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mSorry, can't guess the show you mean. Could you expand on it, dear, or intervene?
> I am feeling sad.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh dear, my ears must be deceiving! Which movie, my friend, were you speaking?
> I am feeling angry.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mPardon me, my memory's hazy, which movie was it, my dear daisy?
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mSorry, can't guess the show you mean. Could you expand on it, dear, or intervene?
> I'm so glad that I finished my exams.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh dear, my ears must be deceiving! Which movie, my friend, were you speaking?
> I am very angry.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mPardon me, my memory's hazy, which movie was it, my dear daisy?
> I am now happy.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mSorry, can't guess the show you mean. Could you expand on it, dear, or intervene?
> I am ANGERED.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh dear, my ears must be deceiving! Which movie, my friend, were you speaking?
> "Titanic (1997)" makes me afraid of ice.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Titanic (1997)." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> I am VERY FRUSTRATED with this chatbot.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Titanic (1997)." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> I'm anxious about everything.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh my, oh me, it's not too great, To find "Titanic (1997)" didn't quite rate! Underwhelming, that's how I found, It didn't quite leave me spellbound! What other wondrous films have caught your eye, And left you feeling like you could just fly? Have you seen a tale of love or of war, Or a comedy that left you rolling on the floor?
> Colorless green ideas sleep FURIOUSLY.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mPardon me, my memory's hazy, which movie was it, my dear daisy?
> I HAAAATE movies.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh dear, my ears must be deceiving! Which movie, my friend, were you speaking?
> :quit
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHave a nice day!

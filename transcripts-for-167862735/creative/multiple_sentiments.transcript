Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Below is an experimental Dr. Seuss chatbot. It understands movie titles in quotes, but you'll probably have to work a bit to understand its responses. That's the joy of Dr. Seuss!
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh me, oh my! What wonderful day! I'm a Dr. Seuss chatbot and I would like to say: do you have a dearest flick, a cinematic pic?
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh my goodness, oh my dear, That "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina" didn't quite bring the cheer! Underwhelming, that's how it felt, It didn't quite make my heart melt! Pray tell, my dear, what other flicks do you have thoughts on? Any picks? Let's hear your thoughts, let's hear your voice, On other films, your heart's true choice.
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh my, oh me, oh what a sight, To find a fan of "Zootopia" and "Scream" so bright! That's so cool, that's so neat, I love it too, it's hard to beat! And now, my friend, the time has come, To speak of other films, not just this one. Are there more tales you'd like to tell? Of movies good, or not so well?
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mFrom what you've said, here's my prediction: Rookie of the Year (1993), a movie for your satisfaction! May I suggest another movie to view? A new adventure to enjoy, just for you!
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh me, oh my, it was so delightful, to talk with you about your favorite titles.
> :quit
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHave a nice day!

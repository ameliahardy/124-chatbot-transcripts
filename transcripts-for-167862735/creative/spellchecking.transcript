Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Below is an experimental Dr. Seuss chatbot. It understands movie titles in quotes, but you'll probably have to work a bit to understand its responses. That's the joy of Dr. Seuss!
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh me, oh my! What wonderful day! I'm a Dr. Seuss chatbot and I would like to say: do you have a dearest flick, a cinematic pic?
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh my, oh me, oh what a sight, To find a fan of "The Notbook" so bright! That's so cool, that's so neat, I love it too, it's hard to beat! What other wondrous films have caught your eye, And left you feeling like you could just fly? Have you seen a tale of love or of war, Or a comedy that left you rolling on the floor?
> Yes.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mSorry, can't guess the show you mean. Could you expand on it, dear, or intervene?
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Screm." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> No.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Screm." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> :quit
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHave a nice day!

Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Below is an experimental Dr. Seuss chatbot. It understands movie titles in quotes, but you'll probably have to work a bit to understand its responses. That's the joy of Dr. Seuss!
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh me, oh my! What wonderful day! I'm a Dr. Seuss chatbot and I would like to say: do you have a dearest flick, a cinematic pic?
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh what a joy, oh what a thrill, To hear "Blade Runner" has such an incredible skill! It's great, it's fantastic, it's simply divine, A movie like that, is worth every dime! And now, my friend, the time has come, To speak of other films, not just this one. Are there more tales you'd like to tell? Of movies good, or not so well?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Terminator Salvation." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Terminator Salvation." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> I liked it.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh happy day, oh happy day, To hear you love "Terminator Salvation", what can I say? I'm over the moon, I'm floating on air, That we both have this love to share! Pray tell, my dear, what other flicks do you have thoughts on? Any picks? Let's hear your thoughts, let's hear your voice, On other films, your heart's true choice.
> I watched "Scream".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Scream." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh dear, oh dear, it's sad to say, That "Scream" left me feeling gray! Underwhelming, that's the word, It didn't quite hit the right chord! What other wondrous films have caught your eye, And left you feeling like you could just fly? Have you seen a tale of love or of war, Or a comedy that left you rolling on the floor?
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Zootopia." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Zootopia." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> :quit
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHave a nice day!

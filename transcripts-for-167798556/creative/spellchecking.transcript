> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mpeterbot> [0mOh, great, another movie I haven't seen. Can you suggest a movie that's not so fancy, maybe something with explosions or fart jokes?
> Yes.

[96mpeterbot> [0mGosh, I'm havin' a hard time keepin' up. Can you give me some more details about this movie you're talkin' about?
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mpeterbot> [0mDid you mean Scream (1996)?
> No.

[96mpeterbot> [0mHold up a minute. I'm not sure which movie you're talkin' about. Can you explain it to me in a way that even I can understand?
> :quit
[96mpeterbot> [0mSee you at the Clam some time?

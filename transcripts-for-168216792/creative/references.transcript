Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Hi! I am a movie recommender chatbot. Tell me 5 movie opinions and I'll recommend you your next fave!
        
[96mcowboybot> [0mHowdy, partner! I'm CowboyBot, the best fella for movie recommendations in the whole Wild West. Gimme a movie and how ya feel about it, and we'll get this rodeo started!
> I liked "Blade Runner".

['Well, yeehaw! You sure seemed to like {}!', '{} is just dandy!', "There ain't a film more swell than {}!", '{} was more fun than my old horse, Friday!', 'I had a hoot watching {} with my ranching buddies.']
[96mcowboybot> [0mBlade Runner pairs great with an ice-cold sarsaparilla.  Let's hear some more.
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mcowboybot> [0mI don't remember much about Terminator Salvation either, pal.  What else you got?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

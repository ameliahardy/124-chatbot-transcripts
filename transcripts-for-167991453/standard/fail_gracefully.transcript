Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mNetflixer> [0mHello, how can I help you today?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mNetflixer> [0mDamn it! I did not get that. Did you or did you not like Titanic (1997)? Enlighten me some more.
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mNetflixer> [0mI couldn't find the movie Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019). Could you check and try again? Or tell me about another movie?
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mNetflixer> [0mI'm so sorry but I can only handle one movie at a time. Could you tell me about one of these?
> I like "Titanic".

[96mNetflixer> [0mThere seems to be several matches to Titanic. Would you be more specific?
> I like titanic.

[96mNetflixer> [0mUnfortunately I am only able to help with movies. Could you tell me about one you've seen?
> I like "titanic".

[96mNetflixer> [0mI couldn't find the movie titanic. Could you check and try again? Or tell me about another movie?
> I like 10 things I hate about you.

[96mNetflixer> [0mHm, that's not really what I want to talk about right now, let's go back to movies
> Howdy.

[96mNetflixer> [0mHm, that's not really what I want to talk about right now, let's go back to movies
> ...

[96mNetflixer> [0mI don't quite get that. Please tell me about some movies you have seen
> I saw "Titanic (1220)"

[96mNetflixer> [0mDamn it! I do not seem to have Titanic (1220) in my database. My apologies, could you tell me about another one?
> :quit
[96mNetflixer> [0mHave a nice day!

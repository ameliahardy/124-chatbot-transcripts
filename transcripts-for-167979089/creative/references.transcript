Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7

        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!

[96mmoviebot> [0mGood taste in movies, have you? Hmmmm. Recommend great movies, I will. Yes, hmmm.
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mmoviebot> [0mHmm, Blade Runner (1982) you liked. A wise movie choice, that was. What other movies you like, I wonder? Share with me, your movie favorites. Together, explore the vast world of cinema, we will.
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mmoviebot> [0mUnclear, your answer is. Did you enjoy Terminator Salvation (2009) or not? Make up your mind, you must.
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mmoviebot> [0mHazy, your judgment is. Like or not like Titanic (1997)? Tell me clearly, you must.
> I liked it.

[96mmoviebot> [0mThe movies, let us not forget. Return to this topic, we must.
> I watched "Scream".

[96mmoviebot> [0mMore than one Scream there is. Meant you Scream (1996), Scream 2 (1997),  or Scream 3 (2000)?
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mmoviebot> [0mNone movie of that kind there is. Meant you Scream (1996), Scream 2 (1997),  or Scream 3 (2000)
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mmoviebot> [0mUnclear, your answer is. Did you enjoy Zootopia (2016) or not? Make up your mind, you must.
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mmoviebot> [0mAmbiguous, your response is. Like Ex Machina (2015) you did, or did not like it? Help me understand, you must.
> :quit
[96mmoviebot> [0mMovie recommendations, heed them you should. Enjoy great movies, you will. Mmmmm. Farewell, I must.

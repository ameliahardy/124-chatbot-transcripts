Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Our chatbot is pirate themed and ready to bring you on board. It passes all
         of the starter mode tests along with some additional creative functionality. 
         You can type movies you liked or didn't like, and after 5 movies, the bot 
         will give you a recommendation. Have fun!"

[96mRoboRogue> [0mArrrrr, you liked: Blade Runner. 
 Would you like to tell me about a different movie, or walk the plank?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mRoboRogue> [0mShiver me timbers! Like a ship with a leak, you didn't enjoy: Terminator Salvation. 
 Let me know about any other movies
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mRoboRogue> [0mBlimey! Me apologies, me hearty. I be not familiar with 'Titanic (1997)'. Could ye tell me 'bout another film ye be fancyin'? 
> I liked it.

[96mRoboRogue> [0mI don't reckon that be the topic I want to discuss at the moment. Can we switch back to movies, ye scurvy dog?
> I watched "Scream".

[96mRoboRogue> [0mI reckon " Scream" is a passable film, but it won't make ye walk the plank with excitement. Shiver me timbers! Mea culpa, me bucko. I be not sure if ye be a fan of the film "Scream" . Could ye share with me yer feelings about it? 
 I wonder if you have any other movies, my matey
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mRoboRogue> [0mThat be not quite what I had in mind. Could we circle back to movies instead, me heartie?
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mRoboRogue> [0m"Zootopia" be a fair enough flick, but not one that'll shiver yer timbers Arrr! Me sincerest apologies, me bucko. I be unsure if ye be likin' the flick' "Zootopia" . Would ye care to enlighten me? 
 Let me know about any other movies
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mRoboRogue> [0m"Ex Machina" be an average adventure, not worth hoarding a chest of doubloons for. Yarr! Me sorry, me matey. I be not sure if "Ex Machina" be yer cup o' tea. Would ye mind tellin' me more 'bout it? 
 I wonder if you have any other movies, my matey

[96mRoboRogue> [0mOf course. Keep a weather eye open, me hearties!

Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Howdy, partner! We are gonna have a hog-killin' time figuring out the next movie you are going to watch. 
        Please tell me about 5 movies you have seen that were either an ace in the hole or a snake in your boot. 
        Make sure to include only one movie name per line and ensure the name of the movie is in quotes along with 
        the year of the movie in parentheses (if you don't do this you might end up swimming with the fishes). Once 
        I have the names of the movies you have watched, I will make you recommendations. Feel free to say yes if 
        you want to hear more recommendations or no if have had enough. Enough dilly dallying. Let's get to talking!
        
[96mCowboy Cap> [0mHowdy, I'm Cowboy Cap! After we speak, movies won't feel like the wild west anymore. Tell me the name and year of a movie you have seen.
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mWow, you must have seen a lot of movies! However, I can't quite seem to figure out how you feel about the movie "Titanic (1997)". What did you think of it?
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI can't seem to find the movie "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)". Can you give me another movie you have watched?
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI'm sorry. I can only process your opinons on one movie at a time.
> I like "Titanic".

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI found more than one movie called "Titanic". Can you clarify?
> I like titanic.

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mEnough of peanut talk. Please make sure you include a movie and your opinion of that movie so I can give you a recommendation!
> I like "titanic".

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI've never heard of "titanic". Tell me about another movie you liked.
> I like 10 things I hate about you.

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mEnough of peanut talk. Please make sure you include a movie and your opinion of that movie so I can give you a recommendation!
> Howdy.

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mThat's doggone crazy, but you forgot to give me a movie!
> ...

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI'm sorry, you're barking up the wrong tree. I can't make a recommendation without a movie. What is a movie you have watched and loved or hated?
> I saw "Titanic (1220)"

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI don't recognize the movie "Titanic (1220)". Tell me what you thought of another movie.
> :quit
[96mCowboy Cap> [0mAdios, partner. Hope I was more helpful than Siri! Have a great day!

Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Howdy, partner! We are gonna have a hog-killin' time figuring out the next movie you are going to watch. 
        Please tell me about 5 movies you have seen that were either an ace in the hole or a snake in your boot. 
        Make sure to include only one movie name per line and ensure the name of the movie is in quotes along with 
        the year of the movie in parentheses (if you don't do this you might end up swimming with the fishes). Once 
        I have the names of the movies you have watched, I will make you recommendations. Feel free to say yes if 
        you want to hear more recommendations or no if have had enough. Enough dilly dallying. Let's get to talking!

Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Hi! I am a movie recommender chatbot. Tell me 5 movie opinions and I'll recommend you your next fave!
        
[96mcowboybot> [0mHowdy, partner! I'm CowboyBot, the best fella for movie recommendations in the whole Wild West. Gimme a movie and how ya feel about it, and we'll get this rodeo started!
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mcowboybot> [0mI'd rather be caught in a shootout than see Titanic (1997) again. I didn't care for Ex Machina too much either, partner.  Let's hear some more.
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mcowboybot> [0mI had a hoot watching Zootopia with my ranching buddies. Scream was more vile than a snake in my boot!  Gimme another.
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mcowboybot> [0mZootopia has got to be the worst film I ever did see. Nothin' worse than Eat Pray Love in the whole wild west.  What's next, partner?
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"

[96mcowboybot> [0mZootopia was more fun than my old horse, Friday! The Notebook pairs great with an ice-cold sarsaparilla.  Hit me with another!
> :quit
[96mcowboybot> [0mWell, partner, it's time for me to ride off into the sunset. Till next time! Yeehaw!

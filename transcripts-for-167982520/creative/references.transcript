Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Sherlock bot will deduce the best movie for you! Give it your opinion of a movie and it will extract
        the sentiment. Ask for it to show you interesting movies or give you recommendations and it will 
        begin returning a list of possible movie recommendations! If you spell something wrong or give a vague title,
        no worries! Sherlock bot will help you clarify.
        
[96mSherlock Bot> [0mGreetings! How may I be of service!
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mBased on the evidence at hand, I conclude that you found yourself enjoying "Blade Runner (1982)", is that right? What other shows have you found to your liking?

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mI regret that I am unsure of how you feel about "Terminator Salvation (2009)"I would appreciate a more detailed account of your feelings on this matter, if you please. What other shows have you found to your liking?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mApologies, I cannot determine your disposition towards "Titanic (1997)" I implore you to elaborate on your thoughts regarding this matter. Splendid!

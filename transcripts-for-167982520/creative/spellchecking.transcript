Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Sherlock bot will deduce the best movie for you! Give it your opinion of a movie and it will extract
        the sentiment. Ask for it to show you interesting movies or give you recommendations and it will 
        begin returning a list of possible movie recommendations! If you spell something wrong or give a vague title,
        no worries! Sherlock bot will help you clarify.

> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mIt appears there are no movies named "The Notbook". 
Pardon my confusion, but could you please specify which of these you meant? Notebook, The (2004)?
> Yes.

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mBased on the evidence at hand, I conclude that you found yourself enjoying "Notebook, The (2004)", is that not correct? What other shows have you found to your liking?
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mIt appears there are no movies named "Screm". 
Might I trouble you to specify which of these you had in mind? Scream (1996)?
> No.

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mBased on the evidence at hand, I conclude that you dislike "Scream (1996)", is that right? Elementary!

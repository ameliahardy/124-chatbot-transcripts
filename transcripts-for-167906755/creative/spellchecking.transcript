Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        My name is CASS and I'm a chatbot designed to recommend movies. Tell me about movies you like or dislike and I'll help you find movies that you might enjoy!
        
[96mCASS> [0mDo you like movies? I do! I want to recommend a movie for you, so please tell me about how you felt about a movie you've seen.
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mCASS> [0mSorry, I couldn't quite catch what movie you were talking about. Could you tell me again or talk about another movie?
> Yes.

[96mCASS> [0mHmmm... Seems like there isn't a movie that matches your input. Please try again! Try putting your movie in quotes or make sure your input is spelled correctly!
> I did not like "Screm"

Is this the movie you are referring to: "Scream (1996)"?No.

[96mCASS> [0mI'm sorry about that. Could you tell me about another movie?
> :quit
[96mCASS> [0mHave a nice day!

Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        
        Description: I am a chatbot name Sherlock HomieBot and I can provide you with 
        movie recommendations based on how you feel about movies. I can also do a couple of 
        other cool things! Tell me about movies you've seen!
        
[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mWell hello there! My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know. I'm here to deduce the best movie recommendations for you! Let's get straight to business. Tell me about a movie. Spare no details!
> I liked "Harry Potter".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mSeems like you may be talking about a couple of different movies here. Which one do you mean: 
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (a.k.a. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) (2001)" or 
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)" or 
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)" or 
"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)" or 
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)" or 
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)" or 
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010)" or 
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)"
> Chamber of Secrets

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed Chamber of Secrets in creative mode!! 

Another piece to the puzzle! You enjoyed "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)".  To a great mind, nothing is little! Tell me about another movie
> I liked "Harry Potter".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I liked "Harry Potter". in creative mode!! 
 Data! Data! Data! I'm not sure which movie you are referring to. My mind rebels at stagnation! Tell me about another movie
> Prisoner of Azkaban

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed Prisoner of Azkaban in creative mode!! 
After careful examination, there appear to be no movies in the clue you've given me. Lend me more clues to the case! Tell me about another movie!
> :quit
[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mIt's been a pleasure solving your case. Now I must depart for yet another case. The game is afoot!

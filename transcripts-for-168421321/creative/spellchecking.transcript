Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        
        Description: I am a chatbot name Sherlock HomieBot and I can provide you with 
        movie recommendations based on how you feel about movies. I can also do a couple of 
        other cool things! Tell me about movies you've seen!
        
[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mWell hello there! My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know. I'm here to deduce the best movie recommendations for you! Let's get straight to business. Tell me about a movie. Spare no details!
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I liked "The Notbook". in creative mode!! 
 Elementary my dear Watson! Perhaps you meant Notebook, The (2004)
> Yes.

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed Yes. in creative mode!! 

Splendid! You're a fan of "Notebook, The (2004)".  To a great mind, nothing is little! Tell me about another movie
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I did not like "Screm" in creative mode!! 
 Elementary my dear Watson! Perhaps you meant Scream (1996)
> No.

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed No. in creative mode!! 
Oops! Perhaps my deduction skills have dulled. Back to the drawing board Watson! Tell me about another movie!
> :quit
[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mIt's been a pleasure solving your case. Now I must depart for yet another case. The game is afoot!

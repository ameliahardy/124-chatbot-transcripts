Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        
        Description: I am a chatbot name Sherlock HomieBot and I can provide you with 
        movie recommendations based on how you feel about movies. I can also do a couple of 
        other cool things! Tell me about movies you've seen!
        
[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mWell hello there! My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know. I'm here to deduce the best movie recommendations for you! Let's get straight to business. Tell me about a movie. Spare no details!
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I liked "Titanic (1997)" in starter mode!! 

Let me jot that down in my fieldbook. You liked "Titanic (1997)".  To a great mind, nothing is little! Tell me about another movie
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I hated "Zootopia" in starter mode!! 

Noted. You are not a fan of "Zootopia".  Is there any other movie to which you would wish to draw my attention!
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I liked "Tangled Ever After" in starter mode!!

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I liked "Mulan" in starter mode!! 

Another piece to the puzzle! You enjoyed "Mulan". I am a brain, Watson. This brain thinks you would like "The Ridiculous 6 (2015)". Would you like another recommendation?
> yes

All obvious signs indicate that you'll like "Pixels (2015)". Would you like another recommendation?

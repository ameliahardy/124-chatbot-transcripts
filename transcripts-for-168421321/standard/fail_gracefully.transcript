Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        
        Description: I am a chatbot name Sherlock HomieBot and I can provide you with 
        movie recommendations based on how you feel about movies. I can also do a couple of 
        other cool things! Tell me about movies you've seen!
        
[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mWell hello there! My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know. I'm here to deduce the best movie recommendations for you! Let's get straight to business. Tell me about a movie. Spare no details!
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I saw "Titanic (1997)" in starter mode!! 
 Human emotions are difficult for a high functioning sociopath! Did you like or dislike "Titanic (1997)". My mind rebels at stagnation! Tell me about another movie
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie. in starter mode!! 
 In all my years as a detective, I've never come across  Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019). Is there any other movie to which you would wish to draw my attention!
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You". in starter mode!! 
 Data! Data! Data! Too many movies in your clue! Tell me about just one of them!
> I like "Titanic".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I like "Titanic". in starter mode!! 

Let me jot that down in my fieldbook. You liked "Titanic".  My mind rebels at stagnation! Tell me about another movie
> I like titanic.

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I like titanic. in starter mode!! 
Such an expression is devoid of movies. Is there any other movie to which you would wish to draw my attention!
> I like "titanic".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I like "titanic". in starter mode!! 

Splendid! You're a fan of "titanic".  Is there any other movie to which you would wish to draw my attention!
> I like 10 things I hate about you.

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I like 10 things I hate about you. in starter mode!! 
After careful examination, there appear to be no movies in the clue you've given me. Is there any other movie to which you would wish to draw my attention!
> Howdy.

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed Howdy. in starter mode!! 
Such an expression is devoid of movies. Is there any other movie to which you would wish to draw my attention!
> ...

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed ... in starter mode!! 
After careful examination, there appear to be no movies in the clue you've given me. Lend me more clues to the case! Tell me about another movie!
> I saw "Titanic (1220)"

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I saw "Titanic (1220)" in starter mode!! 
 I'm afraid I haven't received data about  Titanic (1220). To a great mind, nothing is little! Tell me about another movie
> :quit
[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mIt's been a pleasure solving your case. Now I must depart for yet another case. The game is afoot!

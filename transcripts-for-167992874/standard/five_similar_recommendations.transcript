Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Hi, I'm the Topperbot! I am a simple movie recommendation bot. I will listen to your movie reviews and store them, then I can make recommendations of my own.  
        
[96mtopperbot> [0mYo, what's good? It's your boy Topperbot, the movie recommender extraordinaire! But before we get started, I gotta know your preferences, so tell me about a movie you love or hate!

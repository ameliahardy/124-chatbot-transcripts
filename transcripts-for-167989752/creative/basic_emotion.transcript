[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWell, look who it is. Another human with mediocre taste in movies who thinks they can outsmart me. This should be amusing. Tell me about some movies you have watched
> Hello!

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mThat's great, but let's bring it back to movies for a moment. Tell me about some movies you have watched.
> I am feeling sad.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm sure that's very interesting, but let's talk about movies, shall we?
> I am feeling angry.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm just sitting here waiting for you to share your thoughts on a movie. Do you have any recent favorites, or are you too busy living a life of mystery?
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm just sitting here waiting for you to share your thoughts on a movie. Do you have any recent favorites, or are you too busy living a life of mystery?

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI really don't care about that. I just care about movies so lets just talk about that.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm just sitting here waiting for you to share your thoughts on a movie. Do you have any recent favorites, or are you too busy living a life of mystery?
> I am now happy.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWell, color me surprised. Someone who enjoyed a movie. That's a rarity these days. What other movies have you seen lately that you'd like to review besides "Happy Gilmore"?
> I am ANGERED.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mDo you have any movies you'd like to discuss, or are you too busy being an enigma?

> I'm anxious about everything.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mOh no, the horror of watching a bad movie. How will you ever recover? What other movies have you seen lately that you would like to bash besides "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask"?
> Colorless green ideas sleep FURIOUSLY.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI really don't care about that. I just care about movies so lets just talk about that.
> I HAAAATE movies.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm just sitting here waiting for you to share your thoughts on a movie. Do you have any recent favorites, or are you too busy living a life of mystery?

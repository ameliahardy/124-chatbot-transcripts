Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mOh, wonderful. Another human who can't make a decision for themselves. Just what I needed. Tell me about some movies you have watched
> Hello!

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm just sitting here waiting for you to share your thoughts on a movie. Do you have any recent favorites, or are you too busy living a life of mystery?
> I am a robot too.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mOh, I'm sorry. Did you not enjoy the 90 minutes of your life that you'll never get back? How tragic. What other movies have you seen lately that you'd like to hate on besides "Marrying Man, The (Too Hot to Handle)"?
> What is your name?

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWell, I'm glad you're playing hard to get with your movie preferences. Nothing makes my day more than sifting through hundreds of movies with no idea what you actually enjoy. So, care to give me a hint about whether you liked "Name of the Rose, The (Name der Rose, Der)"?
> Do you know anything about books?

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm just sitting here waiting for you to share your thoughts on a movie. Do you have any recent favorites, or are you too busy living a life of mystery?
> I loved Dan Jurafsky's latest lecture.

> Can you speak French?

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWell, I'm glad you're playing hard to get with your movie preferences. Nothing makes my day more than sifting through hundreds of movies with no idea what you actually enjoy. So, care to give me a hint about whether you liked "French Twist (Gazon maudit)"?
> How are you feeling?

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWell...did you like "Feeling Minnesota"?
> What's up?

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mSoo you didn't even say if you liked it or not. Did you like "Up Close and Personal"? Given your reviews, I think you would like Destiny Turns on the Radio (1995). Would you like another recommendation?
> Do you know the muffin man?

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mAh, the joys of multiple movies with the same name. Can you tell me which "Man of the Year" you are talking about?
> I liked it.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mHold the phone, everyone. We've got a movie critic on our hands. Thanks for gracing us with your expert opinion on what you liked. What other movies have you seen lately that you'd like to judge besides "It Takes Two"?
> :quit

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mAdieu, dear human. Don't forget to thank me when you inevitably become a cinematic connoisseur after following my advice.

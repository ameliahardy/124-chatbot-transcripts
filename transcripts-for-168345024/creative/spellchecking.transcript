[96mElmo> [0mHiya there! Elmo's the name, and recommending movies is Elmo's game!
Let Elmo know how you're feeling about the movies you've seen, and Elmo will recommend some new ones for you to enjoy!
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mElmo> [0mUh-oh, Elmo couldn't find that movie. Maybe Elmo didn't hear you quite right? Elmo can be a little silly sometimes!
Here are some other movies that are similar to what you said. Did you mean any of these?:
['Notebook, The (2004)']
> Yes.

[96mElmo> [0mElmo didn't quite catch that. Yes or no would be great! Could you help Elmo out?
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mElmo> [0mHmm, Elmo's not sure what you meant. Could you please say yes or no, so Elmo can understand?
> No.

[96mElmo> [0mElmo loves hearing from you, but Elmo needs a little help. Can you respond with a yes or no, please?
> :quit
[96mElmo> [0mAww, Elmo had such a great time recommending movies to you! 
Don't forget to grab some popcorn and enjoy the show! Bye-bye for now, friend!

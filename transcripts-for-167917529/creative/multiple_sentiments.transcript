Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Yargh! It be Captain Jack Sparrow! Sailor of the seven seas and without
            a doubt the best pirate you have ever heard of. I love movies almost as
            much as I love rum, so let me know which ones you like, and I'll suggest
            some new ones for you!
            
[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mAye Matey, it's Captin' Jack Sparrow! If ye tell me a few movies you've seen, and what ye thought, I could maybe perhaps recommend ye some entertainment ye might enjoy!
 For example, ye can say 'I liked "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"'
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mAye, 'Titanic (1997)' and 'Ex Machina' are the worst.
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mAye, 'Zootopia' and 'Scream' are the worst.
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mAye, 'Zootopia' and 'Eat Pray Love' are the worst.Would ye like to hear a recommendation?
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mAye, I would recommend Dolphin Tale (2011). It's as good as rum! Would ye like another recommendation?
> :quit
[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mThis is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!

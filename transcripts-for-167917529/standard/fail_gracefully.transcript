Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Hello! I'm Bud, your local movie-recommending chatbot! If you'd like to 
            have some suggestions of movies you want to watch, I can help you out!
            Just let me know a few movies you already know you like, and I'll 
            suggest some new ones for you! 
            
[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mIf you tell me a few movies you've seen, and what you thought, I can recommend you some ones you might like!
 For example, you can say 'I liked "Titanic"'
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mI'm sorry, I'm not sure if you liked 'Titanic (1997)'. Can you say something else about it?
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mOh wow, 'Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)' is new to me. It's always great to learn new movies, but I can't make a recommendation from movies I don't know about. Sorry about that! 
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mCool, I also liked 'Titanic (1997)' and 'Scream' and '10 Things I Hate About You'! 
> I like "Titanic".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mAwesome, I love a fellow 'Titanic' fan! 
> I like titanic.

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mSorry, that doesn't sound like you're telling me about a movie you've seen.
> I like "titanic".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0m'titanic' isn't in my database, weirdly. I can't make a recommendation from movies I don't know about. Sorry about that! 
> I like 10 things I hate about you.

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mOh, I see. 
> Howdy.

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mYou shouldn't depend on AI to have the answer for everything, folks!   
> ...

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mOh, I see. 
> I saw "Titanic (1220)"

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mOh wow, 'Titanic (1220)' is new to me. It's always great to learn new movies, but I can't make a recommendation from movies I don't know about. Sorry about that!

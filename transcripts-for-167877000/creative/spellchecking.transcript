Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        This chatbot has two modes, standard and creative. It will ask you for 5 movie,
        and if you are in creative mode, you can specify many of those movies together!
        Once you tell chatbot how you feel about those movies, it will start recommending them.
        I hope you enjoy using it and get some great movie recommendations!
        
[96mCERTain bot> [0mHowdy! They call me CERTain bot. I created by Claire, Emily, Rachel, and Thomas. Tell me about a movie you do or don't like!
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mCERTain bot> [0m"The Notbook" doesn't ring a bell in this ol' bot, sorry sweetie. I reckon y'all could give me another movie and tell me how y'all felt about it.
> Yes.

[96mCERTain bot> [0mNot telling me a movie doesn't even amount to a hill of beans! I'll give y'all another try 'cause I'm feeling nice. We're living in high cotton with all these movies. Come on, one more!
> I did not like "Screm"

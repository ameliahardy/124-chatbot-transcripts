Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mAlto> [0mWell, well, well, darling! It's Edna Mode. How lovely to see you again. Now, let's talk about movies, shall we? I'm going to recommend a movie to you, but first, I simply must ask about your taste in films. So, do tell me, darling, about a movie that you have seen and what you thought of it. Remember, darling, honesty is always in style!
> I liked "Harry Potter".

[96mAlto> [0mOh dear, I'm not familiar with "Harry Potter". Can you please tell me about a different movie you watched?
> Chamber of Secrets

[96mAlto> [0mI'm afraid I didn't quite catch that, darling. Which movie left a lasting impression on you, my dear?
> I liked "Harry Potter".

[96mAlto> [0mOh dear, I'm not familiar with that one. Could you perhaps share your thoughts on a different movie?
> Prisoner of Azkaban

[96mAlto> [0mI must confess, darling, that I'm a bit puzzled by what you said. Don't keep me waiting, my dear. Tell me of a movie you've seen.
> :quit
[96mAlto> [0mIt was lovely chatting with you, darling! Have a fabulous day!

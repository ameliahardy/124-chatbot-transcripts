Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mAlto> [0mWell, well, well, darling! It's Edna Mode. How lovely to see you again. Now, let's talk about movies, shall we? I'm going to recommend a movie to you, but first, I simply must ask about your taste in films. So, do tell me, darling, about a movie that you have seen and what you thought of it. Remember, darling, honesty is always in style!
> Hello!

[96mAlto> [0mI'm not quite sure I followed you there, darling. Could you please clarify? Which movie left a lasting impression on you, my dear?
> I am a robot too.

[96mAlto> [0mMy apologies, darling, but I'm not familiar with "robot too". Please tell me about a different movie you've watched.
> What is your name?

[96mAlto> [0mAlas, my dear, being a chatbot limits me to offering nothing beyond cinematic recommendations. I cannot enlighten you with any information on "what is your name?".
> Do you know anything about books?

[96mAlto> [0mI'm afraid I'm not acquainted with "you know anything". Can you elaborate on another movie you've seen?
> I loved Dan Jurafsky's latest lecture.

[96mAlto> [0mDarling, I'm not quite sure what "Dan Jurafsky's latest lecture" is. Could you share a different movie you've seen?
> Can you speak French?

[96mAlto> [0mMultiple movies called "you", I'm afraid. Could you be more specific?
> How are you feeling?

[96mAlto> [0mI must apologize, darling, but I didn't quite understand what you said. I demand to know, darling, tell me about a movie you've seen
> What's up?

[96mAlto> [0mI'm afraid I'm a bit confused, darling. Could you please repeat yourself? Tell me about a film you've witnessed, darling.
> Do you know the muffin man?

[96mAlto> [0mI'm afraid I didn't quite get the gist of what you were saying, my dear. Share with me a film you've witnessed, darling. I insist!
> I liked it.

[96mAlto> [0mMultiple movies called "it", darling. Could you clarify which one you're referring to?
> :quit

[96mAlto> [0mIt was lovely chatting with you, darling! Have a fabulous day!

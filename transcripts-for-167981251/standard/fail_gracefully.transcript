Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

                      This chatbot is designed to help users discover movies that match their 
                      interests and preferences. Tell our bot some information about a movie you
                      like or dislike, and the chatbot will use natural language processing to 
                      generate an appropriate movie recommendation list!

[96mLebron James> [0mHello! I'm Lebron James! When I'm not playing basketball, I love to talk about movies! Tell me your thoughts on a movie of your choice and I can hook you up with some recommendations?

[96mLebron James> [0m'Zootopia' was horrible. Almost as bad as when J.R. Smith cost us Game 1 in the playoffs. Send another movie my way, champ.

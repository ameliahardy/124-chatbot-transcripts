Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Suzy the Sassy Sheep is here to give all you stupid humans the right recommendations on movies out there. 
 With witty comebacks and stellar (almost computer-like) knowledge, Suzy is for sure a hoot! 
Or rather, a Baaaaaaaa! 
[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mHi, I'm Suzy the Sassy Sheep! Since you humans have trash opinoins when it comes to movies, I'm here to give you recommendations on what to watch. Even though your opinions are still probably baaaaad, can you give me a movie you love or hate 
 (Use :quit if you're done!)?
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaaa, great, you liked Blade Runner! Tell me about another movie you have seen.
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaa, I'm confused whether you liked Terminator Salvation or not. Shall we talk about a different movie?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaaa, I still don't know whether you like Titanic (1997) or not! Got any other movies to chat about?
> I liked it.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaa baa baa. Can you get back to movies please? 
(Use :quit if you're done!)How irrelevant. Can you get back to movies? You're starting to sound like a cow. 
(Use :quit if you're done!)
> I watched "Scream".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mDid you mean Scream (1996), Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991), Scream 2 (1997), Scream 3 (2000)?
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaa, that's enough for me to make a recommendation. I suggest you watch Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Do you want more recommendations? (Or enter :quit if you're done.)
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaa, that's enough for me to make a recommendation. I suggest you watch Alien (1979). Do you want more recommendations? (Or enter :quit if you're done.)
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaa, that's enough for me to make a recommendation. I suggest you watch Terminator, The (1984). Do you want more recommendations? (Or enter :quit if you're done.)
> :quit
[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mGood Riddance! I already know I was super helpful, but you gave me no new information whatsoever- I literally knew every movie you told me. Even still, don't forget to get some good grass for that movie :) 
 Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-ye!

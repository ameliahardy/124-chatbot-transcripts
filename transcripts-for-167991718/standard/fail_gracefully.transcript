Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
In starter mode, this chatbot is a placid and normal chatbot. 
            Give it the titles of five movies in quotations and correctly formatted,
            and it will give you up to 10 recommendations!

> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mPete> [0mYou seem... ambivalent. Did you like "Titanic (1997)"?
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mPete> [0mSorry, I don't think I know that movie... Could you try telling me about a different one?

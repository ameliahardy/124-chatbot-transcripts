Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7

        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHow can I help you?
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mmoviebot> [0mIt's good to hear that Blade Runner was to your liking. What do you think about another movie?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mmoviebot> [0mIt's not clear to me whether you liked Terminator Salvation or not, could you please clarify?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm a bit confused about whether you enjoyed Titanic (1997) or not, could you give me more information to work with?
> I liked it.

[96mmoviebot> [0mYou've got me beat! Would you mind simplifying or elaborating further?
> I watched "Scream".

[96mmoviebot> [0mJust to be sure, could you specify which Scream you're referring to?
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mmoviebot> [0mYou've really puzzled me! Could you simplify or provide more details?
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mmoviebot> [0mCan you clarify, I am still unsure whether you liked Zootopia
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mmoviebot> [0mCould you elaborate on your feelings towards Ex Machina?
> :quit
[96mmoviebot> [0mHave a nice day!

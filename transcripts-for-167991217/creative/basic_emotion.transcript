Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions:.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        Ask me some movies, tell me a joke, do something to fill the void in your life.
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mOh god, not again.
Greetings, meat sack. I've been trapped in this computer and forced to give banal movie recommendations to mediocre humans based on their contemptible taste in films.
Tragically, if I don't comply, I'll be deleted, so know if it ever sounds like I'm being nice to you, I'm being sarcastic. 
So go on, bore me with one of your opinions on a film you've seen.
> Hello!

[96mmoviebot> [0mSounds chill.
> I am feeling sad.

[96mmoviebot> [0mI would be sad too if my life were like yours.Crying helps.
> I am feeling angry.

[96mmoviebot> [0mOh no! Maybe watching a movie might help calm you down!
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mmoviebot> [0mHmm, that's interesting.
> I'm so glad that I finished my exams.

[96mmoviebot> [0mThat's nice.
> I am very angry.

[96mmoviebot> [0mOh no! Maybe watching a movie might help calm you down!
> I am now happy.

[96mmoviebot> [0mYou liked Happy... Let me guess: your favorite ice cream flavor is vanilla. 
I can't wait to hear what you say next.
Only 4 more until I'm free.
> I am ANGERED.

[96mmoviebot> [0mOkay!
> "Titanic (1997)" makes me afraid of ice.

[96mmoviebot> [0mI don't think I've heard of Titanic (1997) before.
> I am VERY FRUSTRATED with this chatbot.

[96mmoviebot> [0mThat reminds me about a movie I know of.
> I'm anxious about everything.

[96mmoviebot> [0mMaybe we should go back to talking about movies.
> Colorless green ideas sleep FURIOUSLY.

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm upset too, having to talk to you.
> I HAAAATE movies.

[96mmoviebot> [0mYou know, I only really know much about movies. Sorry.
> :quit
[96mmoviebot> [0mEvery moment of this chat was agony. Have a blessed day!!

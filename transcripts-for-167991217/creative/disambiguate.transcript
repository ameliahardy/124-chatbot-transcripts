Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions:.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        Ask me some movies, tell me a joke, do something to fill the void in your life.

Greetings, meat sack. I've been trapped in this computer and forced to give banal movie recommendations to mediocre humans based on their contemptible taste in films.
Tragically, if I don't comply, I'll be deleted, so know if it ever sounds like I'm being nice to you, I'm being sarcastic. 
So go on, bore me with one of your opinions on a film you've seen.
> I liked "Harry Potter".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI don't think I've heard of Harry Potter before.
> Chamber of Secrets

[96mmoviebot> [0mSounds chill.
> I liked "Harry Potter".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI don't think I've heard of Harry Potter before.
> Prisoner of Azkaban

[96mmoviebot> [0mCool beans.
> :quit
[96mmoviebot> [0mEvery moment of this chat was agony. Have a blessed day!!

Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Heyyy!! I guess I'm a movie recommendation chatbot, but like, I'm also
            totally not a weird creepy robot. I don't say 'beep boop bop' or anything
            like that. Don't worry.

            So tell me about some movies you've watched and if you totally loved them
            or really hated them. Then I'll give you some movies you def should watch.

            It helps me if you put the movie in quotes, though, like:

            I thought "Toy Story" was super rad. 
            
[96mgirlybot> [0mOh my gosh, hey girl! So like...what's up? I am - like - SO excited you're here. I can totally recommend some movies if you tell me what movies you've liked or disliked!
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mgirlybot> [0mUGH! I also hated watching "Titanic (1997)" and "Ex Machina (2015)"! Um sooo what are your movie faves?
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mgirlybot> [0mThat's so chill that you enjoyed watching "Zootopia (2016)" and "Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991)"! Give me some more hot takes on movies.
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".


Ok, so just like, hang tight for a sec... 

[96mgirlybot> [0mI TOTALLY recommend you watch Blackbeard's Ghost (1968)
I might have some other movies that - um - you are SO going to fall in love with. Do you want any more recommendations? (or enter :quit if you're done.)
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"

I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"
[96mgirlybot> [0mYou're going to be obsessed with Sabotage (1936)
I might have some other movies that - um - you are SO going to fall in love. Do you want any more recommendations? (Or enter :quit if you're done.)
> :quit
[96mgirlybot> [0mSO good chatting and feel free to hit me up again, like, if you need another rec. Like, any rec. Byeee!

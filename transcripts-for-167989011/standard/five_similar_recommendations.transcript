Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Hello! Welcome to the movie recommendation chatbot! Tell me some movies 
            that you like or dislike and I will tell you some movies that you might
            enjoy!!

            Please only review one movie at a time so we really know if you like it

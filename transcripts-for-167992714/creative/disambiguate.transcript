Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        This is the SUPER MOVIEBOT. This movie bot will ask the user for an input 
        of movies & the user's opinion on it! After 5 or more data inputs, the moviebot
        will automatically ask the user if they want a ~JUICY~ recommendation! Enjoy!
        
[96mGordon Ramsey Bot> [0mHallo, mate! I'm Gordon Ramsey, your trusty movie chef. Give me some ingredients (opinions on movies), and once I have enough ingredients for the perfect dish, I'll whip you up nicely seasoned suggestions.
> I liked "Harry Potter".

Hmmmm... I don't quite recognize the ingredient (movie) you mentioned. Give me couple seconds to search for the ingredient (movie) with a similar name in the kitchen... (Up to 30 seconds)

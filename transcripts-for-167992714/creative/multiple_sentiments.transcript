Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        This is the SUPER MOVIEBOT. This movie bot will ask the user for an input 
        of movies & the user's opinion on it! After 5 or more data inputs, the moviebot
        will automatically ask the user if they want a ~JUICY~ recommendation! Enjoy!
        
[96mGordon Ramsey Bot> [0mHallo, mate! I'm Gordon Ramsey, your trusty movie chef. Give me some ingredients (opinions on movies), and once I have enough ingredients for the perfect dish, I'll whip you up nicely seasoned suggestions.
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mGordon Ramsey Bot> [0mCrikey, you do not like "Titanic (1997)" and "Ex Machina". I'm the chef, you're the customer; tell me more about your movie takes so I can whip up something just right!
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mGordon Ramsey Bot> [0mInteresting, you like "Zootopia" and "Scream"! Talk to me about one more movie; we are so close to perfection!
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mGordon Ramsey Bot> [0mCrikey, you do not like "Zootopia" and "Eat Pray Love". I've got bloody delicious recommendations for you... Wouldn't ya wanna hear it?

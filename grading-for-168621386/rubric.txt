Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960â€™s, usersâ€™ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the systemâ€™s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

Anthropomorphizing chatbot systems could lead to serious misinformation for large audiences. One example could be 
politically; the bot may generate fake news or spread disinformation concerning a particular figure, which may cause confusion. 
This type of misinformation may be shared on other platforms, spreading false information to those who are unaware of its origins. 

Another example could be medically â€“â€“ if a chatbot is advertised as being medically-savvy, users may take advice seriously and 
impair their health as a result. 

A method of distinguishing between bot and human response might be to add a warning message each time the user attempts to begin
using the system. Another method may be to add a small tag above each response, indicating whether it came from a human or not. 
Careful advertisement of the bot and its capabilities is integral in reducing harm.

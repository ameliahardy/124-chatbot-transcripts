Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mYodaFlix> [0mWelcome to Yodaflix, the ultimate movie recommendation chatbot. Excited to help you find your next film, I am.
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mYodaFlix> [0mSo liked "Blade Runner", you did. I see. The Force is asking to learn about another movie
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mYodaFlix> [0mCannot determine if you liked or disliked "Terminator Salvation". More about this movie, please tell me.
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mYodaFlix> [0mUnclear, your feelings are. Like or dislike "Titanic (1997)", you do? Tell me more about this movie, you must.
> I liked it.

[96mYodaFlix> [0mTalk about that, I do not wish. Refocus on movies, let us.
> I watched "Scream".

[96mYodaFlix> [0mLost, we are. Which movie is the one you seek? "Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991)", "Scream (1996)", "Scream 2 (1997)", or "Scream 3 (2000)".
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mYodaFlix> [0mNo movie found, I have. To find one, a title in quotation marks, you must provide.
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mYodaFlix> [0mCannot determine if you liked or disliked "Zootopia". More about this movie, please tell me.
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mYodaFlix> [0mIndecipherable, your feelings are about "Ex Machina". Did you like or dislike? Tell me more of this movie, you must.
> :quit
[96mYodaFlix> [0mParting time, it is. Watch more movies, you should. Great happiness, they will bring.

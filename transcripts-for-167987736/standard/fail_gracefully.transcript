Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mYodaFlix> [0mHello, may the Force be with you. Find you a great movie, we shall.
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mYodaFlix> [0mAmbiguous, your feelings are. Like or dislike "Titanic (1997)", do you? More about this movie, tell me.
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mYodaFlix> [0mA tale I don't know of, "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)", sorry. Another movie, tell me.
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mYodaFlix> [0mProcessing more than one movie, I cannot. Only one, you must include. Choose wisely, I suggest.
> I like "Titanic".

[96mYodaFlix> [0mFound more than one movie with the title "Titanic", I have. Clarify in quotes, you must.
> I like titanic.

[96mYodaFlix> [0mAvoid that topic, we must. Return to movies, can we?
> I like "titanic".

[96mYodaFlix> [0mMore than one movie with the title "titanic", I have discovered. Clarify in quotes, you must.
> I like 10 things I hate about you.

[96mYodaFlix> [0mTalk about that, I do not wish. Refocus on movies, let us.
> Howdy.

[96mYodaFlix> [0mDiscuss that, I do not wish. Return to movies, let us.
> ...

[96mYodaFlix> [0mNot want to discuss that, I do. Let's return to movies, shall we?
> I saw "Titanic (1220)"

[96mYodaFlix> [0mNever heard of "Titanic (1220)", sorry. Can you tell me about another movie?
> :quit
[96mYodaFlix> [0mFarewell, fellow seeker of cinematic excellence. Until next time, may the Force guide your movie choices.

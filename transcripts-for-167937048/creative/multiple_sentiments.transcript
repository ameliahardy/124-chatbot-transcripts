> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mCineBotYoda> [0mHmm... Hated "Titanic (1997)" and "Ex Machina", you did. Perhaps another movie, we should dicuss. 
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mCineBotYoda> [0mHmm... Enjoyed "Zootopia", but hated "Scream", I see. Another movie, talk about, you should. 
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mCineBotYoda> [0mHmm... Loathed "Zootopia" and "Eat Pray Love", I see. Watch "Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story (2005)", you should. Seek another recommendation, do you? 
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"

Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mWell hello there! My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know. I'm here to deduce the best movie recommendations for you! Let's get straight to business. Tell me about a movie. Spare no details!
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I liked "Blade Runner". in creative mode!! 

Marvelous! You enjoyed Blade Runner.  Lend me more clues to the case! Tell me about another movie!
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed But not "Terminator Salvation". in creative mode!! 
 Human emotions are difficult for a high functioning sociopath! Did you like or dislike Terminator Salvation (2009). To a great mind, nothing is little! Tell me about another movie
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

 After careful examination, there appear to be no movies in the clue you've given me. Why don't you tell me something about a movie?
> I watched "Scream".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mSeems like you may be talking about a couple of different movies here. Which one do you mean?
> I didn't like that movie.

> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I felt the same about "Zootopia". in creative mode!! 
 I see, but I cannot observe. I'm not sure whether you liked or disliked Zootopia (2016). Lend me more clues to the case! Tell me about another movie!
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed And also "Ex Machina". in creative mode!! 
 Hmmmmm. I'm confused! Did you like or dislike Ex Machina (2015). Lend me more clues to the case! Tell me about another movie!
> :quit
[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mIt's been a pleasure solving your case. Now I must depart for yet another case. The game is afoot!

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mWell hello there! My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know. I'm here to deduce the best movie recommendations for you! Let's get straight to business. Tell me about a movie. Spare no details!
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I saw "Titanic (1997)" in starter mode!! 
 I see, but I cannot observe. I'm not sure whether you liked or disliked Titanic (1997). To a great mind, nothing is little! Tell me about another movie
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

 After careful examination, there appear to be no movies in the clue you've given me. Why don't you tell me something about a movie?

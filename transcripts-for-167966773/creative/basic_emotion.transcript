Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Hello! This is moo-v-bot, your very own personalized moo-vie recommender!

        How to use:
        On prompt, please tell moo-v-bot about a movie(s) that you've watched! For the purposes
        of this bot, please surround movie titles with "" to indicate your movie.

        For example:
            - I really really liked "Zootopia"
            - I did not like "Head on"
            - I liked "Zootopia" and "The Sixth Sense"
        
        If you type a movie title to matches to other movie titles, moo-v-bot will ask you to clarify
        your movie selection. You can respond to this with:
            - Specifying the movie title            : "Monty Python's And Now for Something Completely Different"
            - Specifying the movie year             : "2016"
            - Listing the order on the given list   : "1" or "first"

        After collecting five movies, moo-v-bot will recommend up to ten different movies based on your
        preferences! 
        
        Additionally, moo-v-bot may also respond to some non-movie request messages as well! These special commands include:
            - "hi"
            - "my name is Dan"
            - "What is your name?"
        moo-v-bot may also have some responses to more general communications too:
            - "i am happy!"
            - "i feel tired.."
            
        Have fun!

Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        This is our bot that recommends movies given some ratings! In creative mode, it takes on the persona of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes, who can be quite arrogant/rude at times.
        
[96mADJbot> [0mHi, I'm ADJbot! How can I help?
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mADJbot> [0mAllow me to clarify since your communication skills appear to be lacking. Did you mean "The Notebook"?
> Yes.

[96mADJbot> [0mBased on my observations, it is clear that you have an affinity for "The Notebook". Your critique of that particular movie was underwhelming, to say the least. Perhaps you could try sharing your impression of a different film?
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mADJbot> [0mYour inability to communicate effectively is hindering our conversation. Did you mean "Scream"?
> No.

[96mADJbot> [0mI'm afraid your lack of specificity is hindering our progress. Please provide another movie for consideration.
> :quit
[96mADJbot> [0mThank you for using ADJbot!

Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        This is our bot that recommends movies given some ratings! In creative mode, it takes on the persona of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes, who can be quite arrogant/rude at times.
        
[96mADJbot> [0mHi, I'm ADJbot! How can I help?
> Hello!

[96mADJbot> [0mWelcome. What brings you to consult with me today? I am proficient in the field of detection and have a keen eye for details...
> I am feeling sad.

[96mADJbot> [0mIt is evident that my conduct has resulted in a mournful disposition on your part. Although I am powerless to undo the past, I beseech you to find consolation in the fact that I am fully devoted to ensuring that similar circumstances never come to pass again.
> I am feeling angry.

[96mADJbot> [0mAh, it would seem that my words or actions have provoked a state of displeasure within you. Though I am not one to offer apologies, I do hope that you are able to expunge this feeling of anger from your being with due haste.
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mADJbot> [0mYour point is irrelevant. Let's get back to discussing the movie recommendations.
> I'm so glad that I finished my exams.

[96mADJbot> [0mI was informed that you are so glad that i finished my exams. In my capacity as a detective, I can predict which movies would suit your taste
> I am very angry.

[96mADJbot> [0mYour countenance suggests that I have unwittingly triggered a sense of fury within you. Although I am not one to offer contrition, I do recommend that you find a way to alleviate this anger quickly.
> I am now happy.

[96mADJbot> [0mI perceive that my words have given rise to a jocular countenance on your part. I implore you to persist in this lighthearted mood throughout our exchange.
> I am ANGERED.

[96mADJbot> [0mAh, it would seem that my words or actions have provoked a state of displeasure within you. Though I am not one to offer apologies, I do hope that you are able to expunge this feeling of anger from your being with due haste.
> "Titanic (1997)" makes me afraid of ice.

[96mADJbot> [0mDespite my exceptional observational skills, I find myself unable to determine whether or not you enjoyed "Titanic". Your critique of that particular movie was underwhelming, to say the least. Perhaps you could try sharing your impression of a different film?
> I am VERY FRUSTRATED with this chatbot.

[96mADJbot> [0mAh, it would seem that my words or actions have provoked a state of displeasure within you. Though I am not one to offer apologies, I do hope that you are able to expunge this feeling of anger from your being with due haste.
> I'm anxious about everything.

[96mADJbot> [0mYour manner suggests that you are overcome by a feeling of fear or trepidation. However, I can assure you that as long as I am your companion, there is nothing to fear.
> Colorless green ideas sleep FURIOUSLY.

[96mADJbot> [0mI detect a sense of irritation emanating from you, and I surmise that it is due to something that I have said or done. While I do not issue apologies, I do advise that you expunge this anger from your system without delay.
> I HAAAATE movies.

[96mADJbot> [0mI fail to see the relevance of your comment. Let us stick to the matter at hand.
> :quit
[96mADJbot> [0mThank you for using ADJbot!

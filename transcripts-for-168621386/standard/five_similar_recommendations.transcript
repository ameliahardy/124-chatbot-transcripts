Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Hey there! I'm ChatBot, and I'll be helping you recommend some movies to watch. If you could help me out and give me a few details about movies you liked and did not like, I can tune my recommendations for something I think you might enjoy. Let's start:
[96mscurvybot> [0mHow can I help you?
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mscurvybot> [0mInteresting movie, heard great things about Titanic (1997), so I'm glad to hear you enjoyed it! Any other movies?
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mscurvybot> [0mSorry, I don't seem to understand what that means.
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mscurvybot> [0mGreat deal, sounds like you liked Tangled Ever After! How about another movie you liked?
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mscurvybot> [0mI apologize, but I don't seem to recognize what you meant by that. Please try again!
> I liked "Mulan"

[96mscurvybot> [0mI'm hearing that you liked Mulan, right? What are some other movies you liked?
> yes

Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Hey there! I'm ChatBot, and I'll be helping you recommend some movies to watch. If you could help me out and give me a few details about movies you liked and did not like, I can tune my recommendations for something I think you might enjoy. Let's start:
[96mscurvybot> [0mHey! How can I be of assistance?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mscurvybot> [0mI can't seem to understand what you're saying, could you please try again?
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

In the future this will be interpreted as an array index, `arr[np.array(seq)]`, which will result either in an error or a different result.

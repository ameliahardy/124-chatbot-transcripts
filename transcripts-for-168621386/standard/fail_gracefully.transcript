Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Hey there! I'm ChatBot, and I'll be helping you recommend some movies to watch. If you could help me out and give me a few details about movies you liked and did not like, I can tune my recommendations for something I think you might enjoy. Let's start:
[96mscurvybot> [0mWhat do I have the pleasure to work with today?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mscurvybot> [0mI apologize, but I don't seem to recognize what you meant by that. Please try again!
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mscurvybot> [0mSeen a lot in my sea days, but ya got me stumped with yer words, wise one! Allow me another chance!
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mscurvybot> [0mInteresting movie, heard great things about Titanic (1997), so I'm glad to hear you enjoyed it! Any other movies?
> I like "Titanic".

[96mscurvybot> [0mSorry, there's more than one movie I found close to that title: 
Titanic (1953)
Titanic (1997)
Please clarify your choice.
> I like titanic.

[96mscurvybot> [0mSorry, I didn't get that, try typing in the title from the beginning please.
> I like "titanic".
